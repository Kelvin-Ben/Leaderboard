# Leaderboard

>The leaderboard project is a dynamic web application that allows users to add and view scores of players in a game. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and bundled with Webpack, the application stores data in the browser with JSON. It features an API that retrieves player data and displays it in real-time. The use of ES6 and linters ensures maintainable and clean code, while npm enables easy package management. The leaderboard project is a demonstration of proficiency in web development technologies, showcasing knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, API, and Webpack.
